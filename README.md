# DateStructInC
A date struct which does a multiple of operations like showing the date in different formats, adding days to the date or getting the difference between two dates.


Honestly wont lie, I took lots of help from the internet, like the add days and difference function. Had to patch some things here and there. Wrote the rest. I have just made the header file, the main .c file which will have all these functions used properly is still left.

# Finished what?
1.All those basic targets which Ma'am gave
2.A very basic C program to show its utlization

# What's left?
1. To make a perfect menu type main c program which can allow user to input the dates and all other functionalities.

# NOTE
By default, day2, mon2 and year2 will be just initialized, use day1,mon1,year 1 wherever only 1 date is required.
Ask user for day2 mon2 and year 2 only in difference function.
